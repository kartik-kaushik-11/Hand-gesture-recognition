PC Control Using Hand Gesture Recognition is an innovative project designed to redefine the way users interact with their computers by employing intuitive gesture recognition technology. By harnessing the power of computer vision and machine learning, this project enables users to control the volume and manipulate the mouse pointer on their PC with simple hand gestures, eliminating the need for traditional input devices. Through real-time analysis of hand movements captured by a webcam or similar device, the system accurately interprets gestures and translates them into corresponding commands, providing a seamless and natural user experience. The project utilizes a combination of OpenCV for robust image processing, Python for algorithm development, and machine learning techniques for efficient gesture recognition. Our goal is to not only enhance convenience and accessibility but also to push the boundaries of human-computer interaction by expanding gesture support, improving accuracy, and integrating additional interaction modalities such as voice commands. We welcome contributions from the community to further enhance and refine this project, which is licensed under the MIT License, allowing for free use, modification, and distribution. Join us in revolutionizing the way we interact with PCs through the power of hand gesture recognition.
